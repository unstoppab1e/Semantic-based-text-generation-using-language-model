# Semantic-based Text Generation using Language Model

This repository contains a project that explores semantic-based text generation using language models. The project leverages the literary works of the famous writer Leo Tolstoy as the dataset. By analyzing Tolstoy's writings, the project aims to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text using advanced language models.

## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize cutting-edge language models to generate text that captures the essence of Leo Tolstoy's writing style. By training on a diverse range of his works, we strive to maintain the semantic coherence and stylistic nuances that define Tolstoy's literature.

## Features

- Semantic-based text generation using language models.
- Dataset consisting of Leo Tolstoy's literary works.
- Preserving the writing style and context of the original author.
- Exploring various language model architectures and fine-tuning strategies.
- Demonstrating the potential of language models for creative writing.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-text-generation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd semantic-text-generation`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Explore the provided notebooks and scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and text generation.

## Usage

- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the Leo Tolstoy dataset for training by tokenizing, cleaning, and formatting the text.
- **Model Training:** Train a language model using techniques like transfer learning and fine-tuning.
- **Text Generation:** Utilize the trained model to generate text snippets that exhibit Tolstoy's style.

## Results

The generated text demonstrates the language model's ability to capture the semantic essence of Leo Tolstoy's works. It produces coherent text passages that adhere to his writing style, making it a fascinating exploration of machine-generated literary content.
